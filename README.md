# WheresMyAntipode

Discover the exact point on Earth directly opposite any location with our interactive 3D globe.
The interface now features a modern dark theme and an on-screen display of antipodal coordinates.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click anywhere on the globe to see the antipodal location along with its coordinates.

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** using a GitHub Actions workflow. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will trigger the workflow and publish the updated site.
